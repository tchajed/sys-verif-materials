# Introduction to Rocq

In this lecture, we'll get an introduction to functional programming and see
how Rocq supports both writing and verifying functional programs.

To write functional programs, we'll start by defining some data types for
our functions to operate on.

```rocq
Inductive day : Type :=
| monday
| tuesday
| wednesday
| thursday
| friday
| saturday
| sunday.

```

Now what we have `day`, we can define functions on days:

```rocq
(** next_weekday is a simple example of a function operating on [day] *)
Definition next_weekday (d: day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday => tuesday
  | tuesday => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday => friday
  | friday => monday
  | saturday => monday
  | sunday => monday
  end.

Compute (next_weekday friday).
```



:::: note Output

```txt
     = monday
     : day
```

::::


```rocq
Lemma test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.
Proof.
  (* The simpl tactic computes functions in the goal. *)
  simpl.
```



:::: info Goal

```txt
  ============================
  tuesday = tuesday
```

```rocq
